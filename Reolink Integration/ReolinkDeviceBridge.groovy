/**
 * Reolink Device Bridge (Internal Parent Driver)
 * Version: 1.6.0
 *
 * NOT user-facing. Created and managed automatically by the Reolink
 * Integration parent app -- ONE instance per SOURCE (Hub/NVR or standalone).
 *
 * Merges two roles: (1) holds the persistent Baichuan TCP event subscription
 * (cmd_id=31), and (2) is the PARENT that creates Camera/Doorbell as ITS OWN
 * children via createChannelDevice()/removeChannelDevice() -- this is what
 * makes them nest under this bridge in the Devices list (Hubitat's nested UI
 * only applies to device-owned children, never app-owned). Camera/Doorbell's
 * parent?.componentX(...) calls resolve to THIS device (their real parent);
 * every componentX() method below is a one-line passthrough up to this
 * bridge's own parent (the app).
 *
 * v1.5.0 -- NVR recording control: a master record on/off switch, plus
 * named per-channel schedule presets loaded on demand. Confirmed against a
 * real RLN16-410 NVR across many rounds of live testing before release --
 * see ParentApp.groovy for the full hardware-confirmed mechanics.
 *  - capability "Switch" (on()/off()) is the NVR's master record
 *    enable/disable -- untargeted at the API level (applies to every
 *    channel of this source at once; there is no per-channel version of
 *    this call). A Preferences-page note explains this, since a bare
 *    "On/Off" switch label alone doesn't convey what it does.
 *  - capability "PushableButton" (push(btn)), the "Preset to load"
 *    Preferences dropdown, and loadSelectedPreset() all load a named
 *    per-channel schedule preset defined on the app's Recording Presets
 *    page. Each preset's button number is assigned once, permanently, and
 *    is never reused even after that preset is deleted -- see
 *    ParentApp.groovy's note for why.
 *  - on()/off()/loadSelectedPreset() are declared as bare, argument-free
 *    commands (confirmed via real Rule Machine testing: a command param
 *    entry with description text but no "type" renders as harmless plain
 *    text on this device's own Commands tab, but Rule Machine's Custom
 *    Action treats it as a real argument slot and passes through whatever's
 *    typed -- a genuine MissingMethodException risk for a zero-argument
 *    command). on()/off() keep their explanatory text on the Preferences
 *    tab instead. loadPreset(presetName) and push(btn) both declare REAL
 *    typed parameters (STRING and NUMBER respectively) that Rule Machine
 *    handles correctly, so neither is affected by that restriction.
 *  - loadPreset(presetName) lets a different preset be called per Rule
 *    Machine branch (e.g. "Away" vs. "Home"), unlike loadSelectedPreset
 *    (one shared Preferences dropdown across the whole device) or Push
 *    (requires cross-referencing a button-number-to-preset-name mapping).
 *    All three ways to trigger a preset coexist: Push by number (closest
 *    to "easy," no typing, number shown right on the device page),
 *    loadPreset(name) (self-documenting per rule), loadSelectedPreset
 *    (manual/device-page convenience only, not for automation branching).
 *  - push(BigDecimal btn): Rule Machine hands a NUMBER-type command
 *    argument to a method as BigDecimal, not Integer, and Groovy does not
 *    auto-coerce between them in that call context -- confirmed via real
 *    testing. Converted to Integer internally before use.
 *  - receiveRecordingEnabled()/receiveRecordingMode()/receiveRecordingResult()
 *    keep this device's switch/recordingEnabled/recordingMode/
 *    lastRecordingResult attributes in sync with what the app actually did.
 *  - Two earlier designs (recordOn()/recordOff() with app-side cache-and-
 *    restore; separate virtual child devices for the switch/buttons) were
 *    built, tested, and fully replaced by the above during development --
 *    neither exists in the code anymore.
 *
 * v1.5.3 -- HOTFIX: restored the stale-connection watchdog (documented in
 * the 1.4.4 history below but found genuinely absent from sendKeepalive()
 * during a real 5-day-silent production outage) and fixed sendKeepalive()
 * silently failing to reschedule itself on an unexpected stage change.
 * Added isEventConnectionStale() for the app's new independent audit job.
 * See ParentApp.groovy's v1.5.3 note for the full incident.
 * Logging refined after real-world feedback: the trigger for a reconnect
 * (staleness detected, socket closed, handshake timeout) is now silent
 * by default (logNormal), not log.warn -- a single reconnect is routine.
 * scheduleReconnect() itself now escalates: attempt 1 stays silent,
 * attempt 2+ is log.warn, and exhausting all 10 attempts is log.error.
 *
 * v1.4.2 -- No functional change to this driver (version kept in sync with
 * the app); the paragraph() hotfix was in the Camera/Doorbell driver files.
 * v1.4.1 -- No functional change (app-side batteryMode self-heal only).
 * v1.3.8 -- Magic-header resync logging dropped to debug tier (confirmed
 * benign, self-recovering Hub-side wire noise under load via multi-day soak
 * testing; still warns after 20 failed resync attempts or an unrecognized
 * message type). On a magic-header mismatch, now scans forward for the next
 * real header and resyncs from there instead of discarding the whole buffer
 * (capped at 20 attempts/read). Added componentSetPir() passthrough. Fixed
 * this driver logging directly via log.info/log.debug, bypassing the app's
 * Log level entirely -- routine logging now goes through
 * parent?.logNormal()/logFull(); genuine failures (socket errors, give-up-
 * after-20-resync, decrypt failure, unrecognized message type) stay
 * unconditional log.warn.
 *
 * UNCONFIRMED: translateToLegacyShape()'s status/AItype -> aiState/mdState
 * mapping (in ParentApp.groovy). Sleep-status pushes (cmd_id=145) are
 * received/logged but not yet acted on.
